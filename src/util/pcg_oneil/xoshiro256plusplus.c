/* This is xoshiro256++ 1.0, one of our all-purpose, rock-solid generators.
   It has excellent (sub-ns) speed, a state (256 bits) that is large
   enough for any parallel application, and it passes all tests we are
   aware of.

   For generating just floating-point numbers, xoshiro256+ is even faster.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s. */
